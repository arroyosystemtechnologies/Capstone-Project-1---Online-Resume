    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>
      I'm a methodical and forward-thinking engineer based in East bay
      California, with a foundation in electrical engineering and hands-on
      experience in network infrastructure, OSP/ISP construction, and project
      management.
    </p>
    <p>
      At UCSF, I work as an infrastructure engineer, where I focus on delivering
      scalable, compliant solutions while maintaining rigorous documentation and
      clear communication with stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      My background includes managing telecommunications projects across the Bay
      Area, navigating complex permitting processes, and coordinating
      cross-functional teams. I'm also expanding into web development and
      digital systems—building HTML-based resumes, publishing GitHub portfolios,
      and automating workflows. I’m passionate about creating systems that are
      transparent, maintainable, and empowering for others.
